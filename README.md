# Real-Time-Train-Tracker
The map is centered in middle Long Island, New York. 
Upon clicking the button, a marker will appear at every Long Island Rail Road train station on the way to Penn Station, changing to the next stop every 1000 ms.
This was already slightly changed from it's original scope of MIT bus stops, but in the future, I would like to import custom markers & change it to a train icon.
